        description: `I developed an NFT generator tool that allows for the production and customization of large batches of tokens. This tool was created to streamline the process of creating and distributing NFTs. In order to make the tool more user-friendly, I collaborated with the design team to implement a visually appealing and easy-to-use interface. Additionally, I utilized TypeScript to improve code reliability and maintainability by preventing runtime errors. This not only improves the overall performance of the tool, but also allows for easy identification and correction of any errors that may occur.`,

        description: `To enhance the user experience on the front end, I incorporated React and Ant Design into the program. This not only improved the usability but also provided a more visually appealing interface. My full-stack web development skills were instrumental in boosting overall performance and functionality of the project. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to mentor senior design students and share my knowledge and experience with them. This not only helped them to improve their skills but also helped me to see the project from different perspectives and learn from their ideas.`,

        description: `I developed an ordering system for tabletop kiosks and QR scans, that included an invoice tracking feature. This system improved the overall efficiency of restaurants by 30% by allowing customers to place their orders from their mobile devices. The focus was on mobile-first design to ensure a seamless experience for customers across all device sizes. This way, customers could easily place their order at the restaurant, therefore allowing the servers to allocate more time for other tasks, and the restaurant could easily track the customer's orders and invoices.`,
